    <h1>What is Digital Justice?</h1>
    <p>Almost everything is becoming digital: from manufacturing processes, agriculture, transportation, education, health, government, to the way we write down notes, gather and process information, and interact with our loved ones. The so-called digital revolution also brought with it
issues of inaccessibility and the digital divide,
walled gardens of proprietary platforms and knowledge, hyper-surveillance, lack of regulation, cybercrime, fake news, and hijacked democracies.</p>
    
</div>

<div class="front-page section" id="sec-why">
    <h2>Key Digital Justice Issues</h2>
    <p>Amid broadening recognition and adoption of info-activist digital tools and methods, intelligence agencies are tapping more tools and platforms to surveil activities of persons of interest, activists, as well as citizens as large. Digital service providers like Google and Facebook have turned to big data collection to bank on each digital interaction of its billions of users.</p>
    <p>A pressing need emerges to integrate basic concepts and practices of information security.</p>

    <h2>What is the PH Digital Justice Initiative?</h2>
    <p>The PH Digital Justice Initiative aims to unpack the characteristics, impacts, and ways forward of an increasingly digital world in the Philippines context. Operating under the lens of equity and social justice, we want to take a hard look at how digitalization, datafication, platformization and intelligencification is affecting Philippine democracy, human rights, labor, agriculture, education, poverty and inequality, and social movements.

        <h3>Electronic Mass Surveillance</h3>
        <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3>Big Data</h3>
        <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3>Information Security</h3>
        <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. </p>
