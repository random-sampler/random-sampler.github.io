    <h1>What is Digital Justice?</h1>
    <p>Almost everything is becoming digital: from manufacturing processes, agriculture, transportation, education, health, government, to the way we write down notes, gather and process information, and interact with our loved ones. The so-called digital revolution also brought with it
issues of inaccessibility and the digital divide,
walled gardens of proprietary platforms and knowledge, hyper-surveillance, lack of regulation, cybercrime, fake news, and hijacked democracies.</p>

    <h2>Key Digital Justice Issues in the Philippines</h2>

<p>The Digital Divide. While the Philippines is deemed the social media capital of the world, millions are still left behind without proper internet access. Many are connected online but only through free internet offered by social media platforms, unaware or indifferent of the massive troves of data being harvested and monetized by the platform. Our internet connection remains one of the slowest in Asia, averaging at16 megabits per second on mobile. It is also one of the most expensive with a rate of 20 US dollars for 5Mbps of internet for a month, or 184 US dollars for a one gigabyte-per second connection.</p>

<p>Precarious Platform-Based Work. App-based services and online freelancing jobs have increased in demand, especially during lockdown, attracting many into the expanding platform-based gig economy that currently employs millions. These jobs, however, do not offer the same job stability and social protections given to workers with employer-employee relationships. The current Philippine labor code does not cover informal and gig workers, and no government regulation currently exists to protect them, thereby making them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.</p>

<p>Troll Armies and Fake News. In the Philippines, marketing firms catered to politicians rely on cyber-troll armies that create multiple fake social media accounts to boost their image and attack opponents. More recently, the government itself has been linked to a military-controlled network of fake accounts and pages that attack organizations and individuals critical of the administration.</p>

<p>Hijacked Democracies. In 2018, it was revealed that the private data of some 1.2 million Filipino Facebook users were harvested by Cambridge Analytica. This data was used for Filipino clients of its parent company SCL group, which prides itself in psychometrics to influence the behavior of groups of people through targeted messaging. Reports showed SCL operating through local proxies with clients such as President Duterte and Bongbong Marcos, the son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who ran with Duterte as Vice President but lost in 2015.</p>

    <h2>What is the PH Digital Justice Initiative?</h2>
    <p>The PH Digital Justice Initiative aims to unpack the characteristics, impacts, and ways forward of an increasingly digital world in the Philippines context. Operating under the lens of equity and social justice, we want to take a hard look at how digitalization, datafication, platformization and intelligencification is affecting Philippine democracy, human rights, labor, agriculture, education, poverty and inequality, and social movements.</p>

        <h3>Electronic Mass Surveillance</h3>
        <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3>Big Data</h3>
        <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h3>Information Security</h3>
        <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. </p>
